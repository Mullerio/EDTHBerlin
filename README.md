## Code for ETDH Hackathon Berlin

Building Simulation Environment to test different detection methods for low flying attack drones that cannot be detected well by radar due to occlusion or radar simply being to expensive while also incorporating the time to intercept. 

## TODO:

Somewhat optimal distribution of detectors inside region given.



Website: 
What always happens: User chooses grid shape thats radar occluded 

1. User chooses start and end point for each attacker drone (possibly also midpoint, but could also do via mean)
2. "complete analysis" i.e. randomly generate attackers from all angles, they either fly straight through the shape or also via midpoint 

for presentation, do 1, choose detector based on their distributions in "optimal" way.
