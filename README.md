## Code for ETDH Hackathon Berlin

Building Simulation Environment to test different detection methods for low flying attack drones that cannot be detected well by radar due to occlusion or radar simply being to expensive while also incorporating the time to intercept. 

## TODO:

Simulation TODO: 

Do some Statistical ANalysis, run on realistic grid -> for full runs see trial_runner (but they might take some time)
