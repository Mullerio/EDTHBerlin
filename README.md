## Code for ETDH Hackathon Berlin

Building Simulation Environment to test different detection methods for low flying attack drones that cannot be detected well by radar due to occlusion or radar simply being to expensive while also incorporating the time to intercept. 

Currently only supporting detection simulation with statistical analysis. 
Further work is also simulating interception.
